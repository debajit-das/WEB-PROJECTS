            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <!-- <br /> -->
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
            of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
          </li>

          JavaScript and Java
          <hr />
        </h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

      <section class="section4" id="Hello world">
        <h2>
          Hello world
          <hr />
        </h2>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <p>
            function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            <br />
            greetMe("World");
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section5" id="Variables">
        <h2>
          Variables
          <hr />
        </h2>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
